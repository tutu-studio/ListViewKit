# ListViewKit

[![CI](https://github.com/Lakr233/ListViewKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lakr233/ListViewKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A lightweight, diffable, reusing list view for Swift, UIKit, and AppKit.

![Preview](./Resource/IMG_0BBF74B35BFB-1.jpeg)

Rows are measured only when they are needed. Everything else is corrected in
slices between frames, so opening a list, appending to it, and resizing it cost
about the same whether it holds ten rows or a hundred thousand.

## Requirements

- Swift 6.0+
- iOS 17.0+ / macCatalyst 17.0+ / macOS 14.0+
- No runtime dependencies.

## Installation

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Lakr233/ListViewKit", from: "3.0.0"),
]
```

## Usage

A list owns its content. Declare the row types once, then hand it arrays.

```swift
struct Message: Identifiable, Hashable {
    let id: UUID
    var text: String
}

let list = ListView<Message>()

list.rows {
    ListRow(TextRow.self)
        .height { message, context in
            TextRow.height(for: message.text, width: context.width)
        }
        .configure { row, message, _ in
            row.show(message.text)
        }
}

list.apply(messages)
```

`TextRow` is your own `ListRowView` subclass. That is the whole setup: one
object, nothing to keep alive on the side.

### Several row types

Registrations are tried in declaration order and the first `when` match claims
the item, so the unconditional one goes last.

```swift
list.rows {
    ListRow(ImageRow.self)
        .when(\.isImage)
        .estimatedHeight(220)
        .height { message, context in message.aspectHeight(for: context.width) }
        .configure { row, message, _ in row.show(message.image) }

    ListRow(TextRow.self)
        .height { message, context in
            TextRow.height(for: message.text, width: context.width)
        }
        .configure { row, message, _ in row.show(message.text) }
}
```

### Changing the content

```swift
list.apply(messages, animated: true)  // replace everything, diffed
list.append(message)                  // add to the end, O(log n)
list.update(message)                  // one item changed, no diff
```

`apply` has to compare the whole array to find out what moved, which is O(n)
per call however little changed. For a chat client adding one message, use
`append`; for a streaming response rewriting one message, use `update`. Both
leave every other row untouched.

Items need unique, stable identifiers. Changing an item's hashable value is
what marks its row for refilling and re-measuring.

### Animations

The list animates what you asked it to animate, and nothing else.
`apply(_:animated: true)` fades insertions in, fades removals out, and slides
the rows in between. A second reorder arriving while the first is still running
adds to it instead of replacing it, so the rows carry their speed through the
interruption rather than stopping dead and setting off again.

Everything else is layout, and layout does not animate. A row entering the
viewport is *placed*, not moved: one coming back from the reuse pool is still
sitting wherever its last item left it, and that is not a position worth
travelling from. The scroll offset behaves the same way — it animates only
while the list is driving it frame by frame, never as a side effect of the
content being re-measured.

This holds even when a list update runs inside an animation of your own, which
is what keyboard avoidance does:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.25) {
    self.list.frame = frameAboveTheKeyboard
    self.list.layoutIfNeeded()
}
```

The list's frame follows your curve, because you set it. The rows that scroll
into view during that same pass do not: they appear where they belong instead
of sliding in from the corner or from whichever item used that view last.
Calling `apply(_:animated: true)` from inside such a block still animates, on
the list's own curve.

To animate something inside a row with the same timing the list uses:

```swift
row.withAnimation { row.disclosure.isHidden = false }
```

### Rows

Subclass `ListRowView` and clear transient state in `prepareForReuse`:

```swift
final class TextRow: ListRowView {
    override func prepareForReuse() {
        super.prepareForReuse()
        imageTask?.cancel()
        imageTask = nil
        label.text = nil
    }
}
```

It is called before every configuration, including the first, so it must be
idempotent.

### Auto Layout

The list writes `row.frame` and never reads a row's intrinsic size. Using Auto
Layout *inside* a row is fine — the list hands over a definite `bounds` to lay
out within.

A row registered **without** a `height` closure is measured from its own
constraints instead, on one hidden prototype per row type:

```swift
ListRow(CardRow.self)
    .estimatedHeight(80)
    .configure { row, item, context in
        row.title.text = item.title            // affects height
        guard context.purpose == .display else { return }
        row.avatar.load(item.avatarURL)        // does not
    }
```

Check `context.purpose` for anything that is not height: a full measurement
pass would otherwise fire one image request per row in the list.

Self-sizing costs one to two orders of magnitude more per row than a height
closure, so the scrollbar proportion converges as measurement catches up.
Prefer a height closure for lists in the thousands.

### Estimates

Until a row is measured it stands at `estimatedRowHeight` (44 by default), or
whatever its registration declared. Only the content height and the scroller
proportion depend on it, and only until measurement catches up — but a value
near the truth keeps the scroller steady.

### Invalidating a row

When hosted or expandable content changes size without the item changing:

```swift
list.invalidateLayout(forRowWith: message.id)
```

Use `invalidateLayout()` only when every height may have changed, such as
after replacing global typography.

On AppKit, a visible expansion or collapse can be expressed as a semantic
height transition. The changed row and its downstream rows move together;
rows crossing the viewport boundary keep their presentation identity, and no
opacity animation is added:

```swift
list.animateHeightChange(
    forRowWithID: message.id,
    animation: .init(duration: 0.25)
) {
    message.isExpanded.toggle()
    list.update(message)
}
```

### Preserving the viewport across structural changes

Capture a stable row's position before prepending or removing content, apply
the change, then translate the viewport by the row's coordinate difference:

```swift
let anchorY = list.rectForRow(with: anchorID).minY
list.apply(olderMessages + messages)

#if canImport(UIKit)
list.layoutIfNeeded()
#elseif canImport(AppKit)
list.layoutSubtreeIfNeeded()
#endif

let deltaY = list.rectForRow(with: anchorID).minY - anchorY
list.rebaseContentOffset(by: CGPoint(x: 0, y: deltaY))
```

Rebasing also translates an in-flight programmatic spring without cancelling
it. On AppKit, native gesture and momentum state remains owned by
`NSScrollView`; apply structural changes while native scrolling is idle when
exact momentum-target preservation is required.

### Following streaming content

```swift
let shouldFollow = list.isScrolledToBottom(tolerance: 4)
list.append(message)

if shouldFollow, !list.isUserInteractingWithScroll {
    list.scrollToBottom(animated: true)
}
```

`isUserInteractingWithScroll` includes platform momentum but excludes
programmatic spring scrolling. The animated call retargets the existing spring
as more tokens arrive, so a growing final row follows the bottom smoothly.

### Scrolling to a row

```swift
list.scrollToRow(at: 20, at: .middle)
list.scrollToRow(with: message.id, at: .nearest)
list.scrollToBottom()
```

### The scroller

A list whose content outgrows its viewport draws a platform overlay scroller.
Hosts that would rather it did not say so with one sentence on either platform:

```swift
list.showsVerticalScrollIndicator = false
```

UIKit inherits the property from `UIScrollView`; the AppKit list forwards it
to its native `NSScrollView`. Either way this hides the report, not the range:
everything still scrolls exactly as far as it did.

On AppKit the complete hierarchy is native:

```text
NSScrollView
└── NSClipView
    └── ListDocumentView
        └── reusable rows
```

AppKit owns wheel and trackpad gestures, momentum, elasticity, clipping, and
scroller behaviour. Programmatic navigation keeps ListViewKit's retargetable
spring so streaming bottom-follow behaves consistently across platforms.

## Migrating from 2.x

| 2.x | 3.0 |
| --- | --- |
| `ListView` + `ListViewDiffableDataSource` + adapter | `ListView<Item>` |
| `ListViewAdapter` / `ListViewTypedAdapter` | `list.rows { ListRow(…) }` |
| `ListViewDataSourceSnapshot` | your own `[Item]` |
| `dataSource.applySnapshot(_:animatingDifferences:)` | `list.apply(_:animated:)` |
| `dataSource.updateItem(_:)` | `list.update(_:)` |
| appending via a snapshot | `list.append(_:)` |
| `listView.rowView(at:)` | `list.rowView(for: id)` |
| `invalidateLayout(forRowWithID:)` | `invalidateLayout(forRowWith:)` |
| `ScrollPosition.none` | `ListRowPosition.nearest` |
| `deferredSizeCalculation` | removed; slicing is the only model |
| `hasVerticalScroller` / `autohidesScrollers` | removed; the scroller appears when the content overflows and autohides per the system preference |
| `AnimationBlockView` | removed; add the list as a subview directly |

The row-kind type is gone. Where you switched on a kind, register one
`ListRow` per row type and select with `when`.

## Tests

```bash
swift test
```

## Benchmarks

```bash
swift run -c release ListViewKitBenchmarks
```

`LVK_ITEMS` and `LVK_BENCH` narrow a run to one size or one path. See
[`Benchmarks/README.md`](./Benchmarks/README.md).

Measured on an Apple Silicon Mac, Release, 800×600 viewport, 100,000 rows:

| | 2.x | Current |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Initial layout | 362 ms | 56.9 ms |
| 20k visible-range queries | 11.8 ms | 2.2 ms |
| 20k content-offset writes | 503 ms | 105 ms |
| 1k tail item updates | 33.7 ms | 13.2 ms |
| Appending one row | 225 ms | 0.03 ms |
| Width reflow | 152 ms | 6.4 ms |

The AppKit offset-write path includes native `NSClipView` and scroller
synchronization. It deliberately trades some synthetic write throughput for
platform-owned gestures, momentum, elasticity, clipping, and accessibility.
